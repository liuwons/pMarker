# pMarker
## A image mark tool based on Qt
I use this tool to mark object position information in images and export to a txt file.

This software is built by Qt Creator using opencv 2.3.1 and Qt SDK 4.8.1 on Windows7.

You can directly download the x86 Windows binary in bin directory, or you can download the Qt Creator project and build it yourself.
